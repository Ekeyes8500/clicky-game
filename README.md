# The Clicky Game!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Clicky Game! This a simple memory game built with React, just simply choose a character to get started! Basically, you have to choose a character, not selecting the same one twice. Once you choose a character, it will randomly shuffle all of them, so try to remember who you've already picked.

If you accidentally choose the same character, it is game over.
